      Next meetup on November 30 2022 in Otaniemi at 15:00. The room is TBA. This will be the
      first of a "library development" series, where we will gradually develop a library together
      and add features step by step. During the first meeting, we will have a general overview
      of a Julia library structure and general development workflow. As always, free of charge
      and refreshment included. If you are coming, please register by Thursday 24th November.

       A conversation about Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility (EDIA) in the RSE
       community: reflections on successes and challenges

      See https://diverse-rse.github.io/events/2023-09-12.
      In the next event in the 2023 DiveRSE series, Ella Kaye (Research Software Engineer,
      University of Warwick) and Malvika Sharan (Senior Researcher – Open Research at the Alan
      Turing Institute and co-lead of The Turing Way) will converse about their experiences in/with
      the RSE community, as well as both the challenges and successes they’ve encountered when
      working to improve EDIA. In a wide-ranging discussion, they will also consider why all RSEs
      should be engaged with EDIA and how they can offer support, as well as broader philosophical
      issues around epistemic justice. There will be time for questions and further discussion.
