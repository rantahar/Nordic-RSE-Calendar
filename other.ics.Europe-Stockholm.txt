In the next event in the 2023 DiveRSE series, Ella Kaye (Research Software Engineer,

Turing Institute and co-lead of The Turing Way) will converse about their experiences in/with
the RSE community, as well as both the challenges and successes they’ve encountered when
working to improve EDIA. In a wide-ranging discussion, they will also consider why all RSEs
